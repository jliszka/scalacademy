Well hello!

You've learned a lot so far! Strings, Ints, Booleans, Doubles, if/else, functions and blocks. Whew!

It's time to step back for a second and talk about how scala goes about evaluating an expression.
Scala's job is to take an expression you give it and reduce it step-by-step to a value. It can be
important to know exactly what those steps are, so I'll introduce them by way of 6 examples of
increasing complexity. Hang tight -- this might be a tiny bit tedious. But it's super important
for what's coming next.

We'll start with something simple: an expression just containing numbers and arithmetic.
---
===
Consider this expression:

  3.0 * (4 + 7) / 2

Scala evaluates this expression using the rules of arithmetic you're probably familiar with:
parentheses first, then multiplication and division, then addition and subtraction.

In these examples, I'll show each step of the evaluation and what subexpression is being evaluated
in that step.

   3.0 * (4 + 7) / 2
          ^^^^^
=> 3.0 * 11 / 2
   ^^^^^^^^
=> 33.0 / 2
   ^^^^^^^^
=> 16.5

Make sense?
---
===
Let's look at a declaration now. Since an expression is just a name and an expression, this just
boils down to evaluating the expression.

   val a = 3 * 4 - 1
           ^^^^^
=> val a = 12 - 1
           ^^^^^^
=> val a = 11
---
===
When the name of a val is encountered, its value is plugged in for the name.

   val b = (a + 1) * a
            ^
=> val b = (11 + 1) * a
            ^^^^^^
=> val b = 12 * a
                ^
=> val b = 12 * 11
           ^^^^^^^
=> val b = 132
---
===
When an if/else statement is encountered, the condition is evaluated first, and then ONE of the
branches is evaluated depending on the value of the condition.

   if (a > 4) b - 2 else b * b
       ^
=> if (11 > 4) b - 2 else b * b
       ^^^^^^
=> if (true) b - 2 else b * b
   ^^
=> b - 2
   ^
=> 132 - 2
   ^^^^^^^
=> 130

The important thing here is that the branch of the if/else that is not taken is never evaluated.
---
===
When a function definition is encountered, nothing is evaluated. The body of the function is saved
as is until the function is called.

   def f(x: Int) = 2 * x + 3
=> Nothing happens!
---
===
When a function CALL is encountered, 3 things happen:

 1. The arguments to the function call are evaluated.
 2. The values of the arguments are plugged into the function body.
 3. The function body is plugged into the expression it was called from and is evaluated.

Let me show you what I mean with an example.

   f(a - 1) + 4
     ^
=> f(11 - 1) + 4
     ^^^^^^
=> f(10) + 4
   ^^^^^
=> (2 * 10 + 3) + 4
    ^^^^^^
=> (20 + 3) + 4
    ^^^^^^
=> 23 + 4
   ^^^^^^
=> 27
---
===
Let's look at another example of a function call.

   f(f(3 + 4) - 2)
       ^^^^^
=> f(f(7) - 2)
     ^^^^
=> f((2 * 7 + 3) - 2)
      ^^^^^
=> f((14 + 3) - 2)
      ^^^^^^
=> f(17 - 2)
     ^^^^^^
=> f(15)
   ^^^^^
=> 2 * 15 + 3
   ^^^^^^
=> 30 + 3
   ^^^^^^
=> 33

In general, expression are evaluated from the innermost parenthese out, left to right.
Arguments to functions are evaluated before the function is called. The function call
itself evaluates to whatever the body of the function evaluates to when the values of
the arguments are substituted for their names.
---
===
Now let's try something a little tricky. Do you remember factorials from high school math?
It's defined this way:

  n! = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x ... x 1

So for example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. Here's an alternative (but equivalent) definition:

  n! = n x (n-1)!
  with the special case that 1! = 1

Make sense? Think about it for a minute to make sure you get why this definition is the same as
the first one.
---
===
Now, how would you implement the factorial function in scala? Thankfully we can translate the
second definition almost directly into code! It looks like this:

  def factorial(n: Int): Int = if (n == 1) 1 else n * factorial(n-1)

Try typing that in and making sure it works. Make sure you get factorial(3) = 6 and
factorial(5) = 120.
---
hasTypeFn("factorial", "(n: Int)", "Int")
eval[Int]("factorial(4)", 24)
eval[Int]("factorial(10)", 3628800)
===
Cool! One thing to notice is that there's an extra ": Int" between the argument list and the =.
It just indicates the return type of the function, and is usually optional in scala. The only
time it is required is when the function body makes a call to the function itself. Functions that
"call themselves" like that are called recursive functions. 

Let's walk through the evaluation of factorial(3) so you get how it works.
---
===
   factorial(3)
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^
=> if (3 == 1) 1 else 3 * factorial(3 - 1)
       ^^^^^^
=> if (false) 1 else 3 * factorial(3 - 1)
   ^^
=> 3 * factorial(3 - 1)
                 ^^^^^
=> 3 * factorial(2)
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^
=> 3 * (if (2 == 1) 1 else 2 * factorial(2 - 1))
            ^^^^^^
=> 3 * (if (false) 1 else 2 * factorial(2 - 1))
        ^^
=> 3 * (2 * factorial(2 - 1))
                      ^^^^^
=> 3 * (2 * factorial(1))
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^
=> 3 * (2 * (if (1 == 1) 1 else 1 * factorial(1 - 1)))
                 ^^^^^^
=> 3 * (2 * (if (true) 1 else 1 * factorial(1 - 1)))
             ^^
=> 3 * (2 * (1))
        ^^^^^^^
=> (3 * 2)
    ^^^^^
=> 6

Whew!

You might have been worried that a function that calls itself would just loop around forever.
But that's what "if (n == 1)" is for -- it provides an escape hatch to jump out of a potentially
infinite loop. Every recursive function must have an escape hatch like this (usually called the
base case), or else it will indeed run forever. (Don't worry though -- if you call a function
that calls itself forever, Scala will detect it and report a StackOverflowError.)

Okay, now (finally) it's time to write some code. Write a function called sum1toN that returns
the sum of the numbers between 1 and n. For example, sum1toN(10) = 55. Here's some code to
get you started.

  def sum1toN(n: Int): Int = ...

Use factorial for inspiration. And don't forget the base case!
---
hasTypeFn("sum1toN", "(n: Int)", "Int")
eval[Int]("sum1toN(50)", 1275)
eval[Int]("sum1toN(100)", 5050)
===
Great!! Here are some rules of thumb for building recursive functions. These are simple rules
and if you follow them, you are almost guaranteed to produce correct code.

  1. Handle the simplest case in the base case. This is usually when the argument is 1 or 0.
  2. For the other cases:
    a. Phrase the problem in terms of a slightly smaller version of itself.
    b. Pretend your function already works for that smaller case and use it to compute
       "most" of the answer.
    c. Then write some code to get the rest of the way to the answer you want.
---
===
For example, when you wrote sum1toN, your base case was "if (n == 1) 1". For the other cases,
you can rephrase "the sum from 1 to n" as "n plus the sum from 1 to n-1". If you pretend that
sum1toN(n-1) works, you can use that to compute "the sum from 1 to n-1" which is "most" of the
answer. Then the only thing left is to implement the "rest" of the answer, which is just adding
n to it. So you get:

  def sum1toN(n: Int): Int = if (n == 1) 1 else n + sum1toN(n-1)

Let's put that to use in another exercise. We'll write code to answer the following questions:
If you have, say, 25 people in a room, what is the probability that no two people have the same
birthday?

Don't worry, I'll walk you through it.
---
===
Let's use the rules to break down the problem. First, let's handle the simple case. If there's
one person in the room, what is the probability that no two people have the same birthday?

Well, it's trivially 100%% (1.0). So you would write

  def differentBirthdays(people: Int): Double = if (people == 1) 1.0 else ???

Now, what about the other cases? How do you break down the problem into a smaller version of
itself? Think about it for a minute and I'll walk through the rest after you type ok.
---
===
Let's break it down recursive style. The probability that, say, 10 people all have different
birthdays is just:

  - the probability that 9 people have different birthdays, times
  - the probability that the 10th person has a different birthday from the other 9.

That's all there is to it! Let's examine each piece in more detail.

We can compute the probability that 9 people (or, generally, n-1 people) have different birthdays
just by calling differentBirthdays (pretending that it already works for n-1). Easy!

The probability that the 10th person (more generally, the nth person) has a different birthday from
the other 9 people (n-1 people) is 356 / 365.0 (generally, (365 - (n-1)) / 365.0), because there are 9
(n-1) birthdays already "taken" out of the available 365.

You should now be able to finish writing differentBirthdays by filling in the ???.

Try differentBirthdays(25) and see what you get!
---
hasTypeFn("differentBirthdays", "(people: Int)", "Double")
eval[Double]("differentBirthdays(25)", 0.431300296030536)
eval[Double]("differentBirthdays(30)", 0.2936837572807312)
eval[Double]("differentBirthdays(50)", 0.029626420422011596)
===
Wow, the probability of 25 people having different birthdays is only 43%%! If you walk into
a room and there are 25 people there, the chances are better than even odds that 2 of them
share a birthday. Crazy!

And if there are 50 people in the room, it's almost certain (97%%!) that two of them share
a birthday!
---
===
More fun with math! Did you know that the square of the sum is the sum of the cubes?

  (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)^2 == (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ... + n^3)

For instance, 

  (1 + 2 + 3)^2 = 6^2 = 36
  1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36

Well, it happens to work for n = 3, but do you think that's really true for every number? Let's
try it out!

First, write a function called sumOfCubes that takes an Int n and returns the sum of the cubes of
the numbers from 1 to n. (You can just use n*n*n to compute the cube of n.)

Write it recursively! You should get sumOfCubes(10) = 3025.
---
hasTypeFn("sumOfCubes", "(n: Int)", "Int")
eval[Int]("sumOfCubes(20)", 44100)
eval[Int]("sumOfCubes(100)", 25502500)
===
Great!

Now write a function called squareOfSum that takes an Int n and returns the square of the sum
of the numbers from 1 to n. (This function doesn't have to be recursive; you can call the sum1toN
function you wrote earlier and square the result.)

Hint: Don't duplicate work! Use a block!
---
hasTypeFn("squareOfSum", "(n: Int)", "Int")
eval[Int]("squareOfSum(20)", 44100)
eval[Int]("squareOfSum(100)", 25502500)
===
Good! Now try it out for a few different numbers. I get

  sumOfCubes(41)  = 741321
  squareOfSum(41) = 741321

Okay! But that's not really good enough. Maybe there's some number we didn't try that it doesn't
work for. Well, we can't try *every* number, but we can try it out for every number up to some
number we specify.

For instance, I might want to know whether

  sumOfCubes(1) == squareOfSum(1) and
  sumOfCubes(2) == squareOfSum(2) and
  sumOfCubes(3) == squareOfSum(3) and
  ...
  sumOfCubes(n) == squareOfSum(n)

for some number n.

Write a recursive function called worksForEverythingUpTo that takes an Int n and returns a Boolean
indicating whether sumOfCubes(i) == squareOfSum(i) for every number i between 1 and n.

Don't forget the base case! And especially don't forget about &&!
---
hasTypeFn("worksForEverythingUpTo", "(n: Int)", "Boolean")
eval[Boolean]("worksForEverythingUpTo(10)", true)
eval[Boolean]("worksForEverythingUpTo(100)", true)
eval[Boolean]("worksForEverythingUpTo(1000)", true)
eval[Boolean]("worksForEverythingUpTo(10000)", true)
===
Pretty cool! It's great getting computers to do all the work, isn't it?

Here's how I did it. There's more than one way!

  def worksForEverythingUpTo(n: Int): Boolean = {
    val worksForN = sumOfCubes(n) == squareOfSum(n)
    if (n == 1) 
      worksForN
    else
      worksForN && worksForEverythingUpTo(n-1)
  }
